🎤 Format: Distinguished speakers will present their topics in a plenary pitch, setting the stage for insightful discussions. Following these pitches, participants can freely choose the discussion they're most passionate about and join the conversation.

📝 Call for Topics: If you're enthusiastic about sharing your expertise and insights, we encourage you to send a concise description of your topic to: [info@watermatex2023](info@watermatex2023).org by September 10th.
