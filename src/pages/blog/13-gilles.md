🌟 Keynote Alert for Watermatex 2023! 🎤

As part of Watermatex 2023, we're thrilled to present an enlightening keynote by Dr. [Gilles Patry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilles-patry-71223119/), a true visionary in the field of modelling, simulation, and control of wastewater treatment plants.

📖 In the conference's closing session, our esteemed speaker will deliver a keynote entitled: "An Integrated Computer Control System (IC2S) for wastewater treatment plant operation – A Digital Twin ‘Avant la lettre!’ (i.e., ‘Before it existed’)."

In his talk, Dr. Patry will transport us back to 1987, the birth year of the idea of an AI-based computer control system for wastewater treatment plants. This visionary concept united innovative elements like real-time monitoring sensors, multivariate control, and on-line dynamic wastewater treatment plant simulation. During this enlightening presentation, Dr. Patry will delve into the genesis of the IC2S concept, its key components, the challenges it was exposed to and the remarkable individuals who contributed to its development.

🌐 Dr. Patry is a pioneer in environmental systems modelling and co-founder of [Hydromantis Environmental Software Solutions, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydromantis-inc./), which played a pivotal role in the development of [GPS-X](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/gps-x/about/)™, one of the first dynamic wastewater treatment modelling software that set the benchmark for this type of tool.

With a distinguished career spanning academia, consulting, and leadership roles, Dr. Patry has made an indelible mark on the world of water engineering. His accomplishments include being a professor at three different Canadian universities, serving as President of the University of Ottawa, as President and CEO of the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and leading the U15 - The Group of Canadian Research-Intensive Universities.

He has received honorary doctorates from several prestigious institutions and is recognized as a Member of the Order of Canada, a recipient of the Order of Ontario, and a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society of Canada.
