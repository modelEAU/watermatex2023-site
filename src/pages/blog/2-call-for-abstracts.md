## Watermatex2023 - September 24-27

Dear fellow researchers,

The 11th IWA Symposium on Modelling and Integrated Assessment (Watermatex 2023) will provide a great forum to exchange methodologies and international experiences on all aspects of water-related problems within an interdisciplinary framework that relies heavily on different types of models. Integrated Assessment aims at bringing all aspects of a problem together, and is particularly concerned with such issues as the social and economic impacts of solutions to these problems. The symposium’s contributions are not restricted to any single discipline but extend to problems in drinking water treatment and distribution, sewer systems and wastewater treatment, surface and groundwater, technical and natural systems. Watermatex aims at promoting the application of mathematical methods for modelling and simulation, data management, systems analysis and decision support within the entire water sector. It targets people from research, consulting companies, institutions and utilities. However, contributions are expected to have a methodological focus.

The MIA Specialist Group of IWA organizes Watermatex as a quadrennial symposium. The first one dates back to 1987 in London, UK. The most recent editions were in June 2015 in Gold Coast, Australia and in September 2019 in Copenhagen, Denmark. We look forward to welcoming you during the Indian summer in Québec City, Canada in September 2023 for the 11th IWA Symposium on MIA.

## Philosophy
The conference program will consist of 3 parallel sessions and interactive keynote sessions (2 experts, 2 visions). Posters will get the attention they deserve through a dedicated poster cocktail session. Other key aspects will be the organization of a professional development session as well as a call for issues to provide a platform to discuss problems and ongoing work. Several parallel full-day workshops will be scheduled for Sunday in an effort to lay the groundwork for consensus building on topics selected by the scientific committee from submitted proposals. These workshops will be preceded by a YWP workshop (on Saturday) organized and attended by YWP (Young Water Professionals).

## Submissions

The deadline for abstract submission for the symposium is April 10 2023. Groups interested in presenting their ideas at the seminar should submit an extended abstract for a platform presentation or a workshop. Abstracts should not exceed 2 pages of text + 2 pages of figures.
