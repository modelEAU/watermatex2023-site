🌟🔍 Young Water Professionals (YWPs), get ready for an immersive experience that will broaden your modelling perspectives on the first day of Watermatex 2023! 🌊🧠

Join us for an enlightening YWP Workshop: "How do availability and quality of the data impact the way we model water systems? Challenges and good practice." 🗓️🕘

Saturday, September 23rd, will be a day filled with knowledge-sharing, interactive sessions, and hands-on experiences:

🤝 Let's kick off with an icebreaker activity, followed by an introduction to the IWA MIA Specialist Group on Modelling and Integrated Assessment by Saba Daneshgar.

🔑 Jean-David Therrien will set the scene with a captivating keynote address.

☕ Part I of the workshop will involve keynotes from modelling experts who will explore the notion of "good" data and what it implies:

🔬 Mechanistic modelling perspective: Beñat Elduayen Echave

📈 Data-driven modelling perspective: Mostafa Khalil

🔬📈 Hybrid modelling perspective: Mariane S.

💬 This will be followed by a lively Q&A and discussion session

🍽️ Part II of the workshop will involve collaborative group work on three real-world case studies where participants will collectively brainstorm solutions to the challenges followed by a reporting session and stimulating general discussion.

🎉 The workshop will wrap up with valuable takeaways and closing remarks.

Workshop sessions are organized and moderated by the Watermatex YWP steering committee: Saba Daneshgar, Kester McCullough, P.E., Helieh abasi, Fanlin Meng, and Hanna Molin.

This is your opportunity to connect with fellow YWPs, learn from accomplished professionals, and tackle complex water modelling issues head-on. Don't miss out on this unique chance to enrich your knowledge and expand your network.
